**Origins:**
The Border Collie is a breed known for its incredible intelligence and herding abilities. Its history dates back to the 19th century when dogs were bred on the border of England and Scotland for farm work, assisting in managing sheep.

**Intelligence and Farm Work:**
The Border Collie quickly gained a reputation as the most intelligent breed of dogs. It impressed breeders with its ability to learn quickly and exceptional understanding of commands. On the farm, it was invaluable for managing flocks, responding to subtle herding signals.

**Sports and Competitions:**
Today, the Border Collie is valued not only for farm work but also as a talented competitor in various disciplines such as agility, obedience, or dog dancing. Its versatility and eagerness to learn make it an excellent companion in various fields.

# Genetic Issues in Border Collie üß¨
**Gene Proliferation:**
One issue associated with Border Collie breeding is gene proliferation, especially in the working population. In some cases, excessive selection for herding traits may lead to the concentration of certain genes, promoting the occurrence of genetic diseases.

**Genetic Diseases:**
Border Collies are prone to various genetic diseases, including issues with the nervous system, eye diseases, or sensitivity to certain medications. Among them are epilepsy, hip dysplasia, and eye diseases such as characteristic pathologies associated with the MDR1 gene, affecting tolerance to some medications.

**Importance of Responsible Breeding:**
To limit the occurrence of genetic problems, it is crucial to conduct breeding following ethical and genetic principles. Responsible breeders aim to maintain the health and distinctive traits of the breed, avoiding excessive gene proliferation.
